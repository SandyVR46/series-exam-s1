Algorithm to reverse a doubly linked list
 Input : head {Pointer to first node of the list}
         last {Pointer to last node of the list}
Begin:
    current ← head;
    While (current != NULL) do
        temp ← current.next;
        current.next ← current.prev;
        current.prev ← temp;
        
        current ← temp;
    End while
    temp ← head;
    head ← last;
    last ← temp;
End
