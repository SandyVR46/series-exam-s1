Let us assume that the two linked lists are referenced by head1 and head2 respectively.

1. If the first linked list is empty then return head2.
2. If the second linked list is empty then return head1.
3. Store the address of the starting node of the first linked list in a pointer variable, say p.
4. Move the p to the last node of the linked list through simple linked list traversal
technique.
5. Store the address of the first node of the second linked
list in the next field of the node pointed by p. Return head1.
