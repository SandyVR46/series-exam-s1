ALGORITHM
Step 1 - Include all the header files which are used in the program. And declare all the user defined functions.
Step 2 - Define a 'Node' structure with two members data and next.
Step 3 - Define a Node pointer 'top' and set it to NULL.
Step 4 - Implement the main method by displaying Menu with list of operations and make suitable function calls in the main method.

PUSH
Step 1 - Create a newNode with given value.
Step 2 - Check whether stack is Empty (top == NULL)
Step 3 - If it is Empty, then set newNode → next = NULL.
Step 4 - If it is Not Empty, then set newNode → next = top.
Step 5 - Finally, set top = newNode.

POP

Step 1 - Check whether stack is Empty (top == NULL).
Step 2 - If it is Empty, then display "Stack is Empty!!! Deletion is not possible!!!" and terminate the 	 function
Step 3 - If it is Not Empty, then define a Node pointer 'temp' and set it to 'top'.
Step 4 - Then set 'top = top → next'.
Step 5 - Finally, delete 'temp'. (free(temp)).

DISPLAY
Step 1 - Check whether stack is Empty (top == NULL).
Step 2 - If it is Empty, then display 'Stack is Empty!!!' and terminate the function.
Step 3 - If it is Not Empty, then define a Node pointer 'temp' and initialize with top.
Step 4 - Display 'temp → data --->' and move it to the next node. Repeat the same until temp reaches to the first node in the stack. (temp → next != NULL).
Step 5 - Finally! Display 'temp → data ---> NULL'.
