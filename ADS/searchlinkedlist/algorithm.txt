Algorithm to create a linear linked list and search whether a key is present or not

	1. Input element to search from user. Store it in some variable say keyToSearch.
	2. Declare two variable one to store index of found element and other to iterate through list. Say index = 0; and struct node *curNode = head;
	3. If curNode is not NULL and its data is not equal to keyToSearch. Then, increment index and move curNode to its next node.
	4. Repeat step 3 till curNode != NULL and element is not found, otherwise move to 5th step.
	5.If curNode is not NULL, then element is found hence return index otherwise -1.
